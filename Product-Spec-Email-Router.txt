# Product Specification: Email Router System

## Overview
The Email Router System is an intelligent email processing and routing solution that automatically categorizes, prioritizes, and routes incoming emails to appropriate handlers or departments based on content analysis, sender information, and predefined business rules.

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Email Classification
- **Content Analysis**: Natural language processing to understand email content and intent
- **Sender Recognition**: Automatic identification of sender types (customer, vendor, internal, etc.)
- **Priority Assessment**: Automatic priority assignment based on urgency indicators and business rules
- **Category Assignment**: Classification into predefined categories (support, sales, billing, etc.)

### 2. Routing Engine
- **Rule-Based Routing**: Configurable rules for routing emails based on multiple criteria
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute emails evenly among available handlers
- **Escalation Logic**: Automatic escalation for high-priority or unresolved emails
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Default routing when primary rules don't match

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- **Email Providers**: Support for major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Exchange)
- **CRM Integration**: Seamless integration with customer relationship management systems
- **Ticketing Systems**: Direct integration with support ticketing platforms
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for external system integration

### 4. Monitoring and Analytics
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of email flow and routing performance
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, routing accuracy, and handler workload
- **Reporting**: Comprehensive reports on email patterns and system performance
- **Alerts**: Configurable alerts for system issues or unusual patterns

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- **Microservices Design**: Scalable, containerized microservices architecture
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing using message queues (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for configuration and MongoDB for email content storage
- **Caching**: Redis for high-performance caching of routing rules and classifications

### Security
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for email content and metadata
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for system access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different user types
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all system activities

### Performance Requirements
- **Throughput**: Process minimum 10,000 emails per hour
- **Latency**: Average routing decision within 2 seconds
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling to handle peak loads

## Business Rules

### Priority Levels
1. **Critical**: System outages, security incidents, executive communications
2. **High**: Customer complaints, billing issues, urgent requests
3. **Medium**: General inquiries, routine requests, internal communications
4. **Low**: Marketing emails, newsletters, automated notifications

### Routing Categories
- **Customer Support**: Product issues, technical problems, general inquiries
- **Sales**: Lead inquiries, product information requests, pricing questions
- **Billing**: Payment issues, invoice questions, account problems
- **Technical**: System issues, integration problems, API questions
- **General**: Unclassified emails, miscellaneous requests

### Escalation Rules
- **Time-based**: Escalate if no response within defined timeframes
- **Priority-based**: Immediate escalation for critical priority emails
- **Keyword-based**: Escalate emails containing specific keywords (legal, urgent, etc.)
- **Sender-based**: Special handling for VIP customers or executives
