# Udacity Feedback - Issues to Fix

## Overview
The project is well-structured but needs several key fixes before resubmission.

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. ✅ Product Spec Loading
- **Issue**: The content of `Product-Spec-Email-Router.txt` is not loaded into a `product_spec` variable in `agentic_workflow.py`
- **Required**: Load the file content into a variable named `product_spec`
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` line 125-133

### 2. ✅ Specialized Agent Instantiation
- **Issue**: Need to instantiate specialized knowledge agents for each role with correct personas
- **Required**: 
  - ActionPlanningAgent with `knowledge_action_planning`
  - Complete `knowledge_product_manager` by appending `product_spec`
  - KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for Product Manager with `persona_product_manager` and completed `knowledge_product_manager`
  - KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for Program Manager with `persona_program_manager` and `knowledge_program_manager`
  - KnowledgeAugmentedPromptAgent for Development Engineer with `persona_dev_engineer` and `knowledge_dev_engineer`
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 135-158

### 3. ✅ Evaluation Agents Instantiation
- **Issue**: Need separate EvaluationAgent instances for each role with specific personas and criteria
- **Required**:
  - EvaluationAgent for Product Manager with specific persona and user story evaluation criteria
  - EvaluationAgent for Program Manager with program manager persona and multi-line product feature criteria
  - EvaluationAgent for Development Engineer with dev engineer persona and multi-line task criteria
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 160-175

### 4. ✅ Routing Agent Configuration
- **Issue**: RoutingAgent's `agents` attribute should be a list of dictionaries, not a dictionary of agent instances
- **Required**: Each dictionary should have `name`, `description`, and `func` for each specialized route
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 177-203

### 5. ✅ Support Functions Implementation
- **Issue**: Need proper support functions that chain knowledge agent's `respond()` to evaluation agent's `evaluate()`
- **Required**:
  - `product_manager_support_function`
  - `program_manager_support_function` 
  - `development_engineer_support_function`
  - Each should: accept input query → call knowledge agent's `respond()` → pass to evaluation agent's `evaluate()` → return validated result
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 210-329 and `support_functions_corrected.py`

### 6. ✅ Main Workflow Orchestration
- **Issue**: Workflow should dynamically extract and iterate over `workflow_steps` from `action_planning_agent`
- **Required**:
  - Use `action_planning_agent` to get list of `workflow_steps` from `workflow_prompt`
  - Iterate through steps
  - For each step: print step → call `routing_agent.route()` → append to `completed_steps` → print result
  - Print final output after all steps
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 331-411

### 7. ✅ Final Output Format
- **Issue**: Ensure final structured output includes user stories, product features, and engineering tasks in exact required formats
- **Required**: Double-check output format matches rubric requirements
- **Status**: COMPLETED - Implemented with proper evaluation criteria for user stories, product features, and engineering tasks in `agentic_workflow_corrected.py` lines 45-65
